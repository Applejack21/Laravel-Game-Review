# Review System

Review system that is built in Laravel 5.7 that allows users to upload reviews of games and comment on other reviews.

The system uses:
- Charts from Chart.js to display how many reviews the user has made per rating (0-5) and how many comments they have
made on the system.
- An email is sent if someone comments on one of your reviews.
- Verification of the user's email, to prove they are who they say they are.
- Bootstrap to help with overall CSS
- jQuery UI to help with overall style and additions to the system.

Please note: The latest commit (8b31560) seems to have deleted all other commits between 26/03 to the 09/03. I have no idea how this happen, nor a way to restore the previous commits.
