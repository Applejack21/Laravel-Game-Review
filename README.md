# Game Review System
George Goodall | George_Goodall@hotmail.co.uk

Review system that is built in Laravel 5.7 that allows users to upload reviews of games and comment on other reviews.

The system includes:
- Charts from Chart.js to display how many reviews the user has made per rating (0-5) and how many comments they have
made on the system
- An email is sent if someone comments on one of your reviews
- Verification of the user's email, to prove they are who they say they are. This has been made using the built-in verification of Laravel 5.7
- Pagination to help limit the amount shown on each page, styled with Bootstrap
- Bootstrap to help with overall CSS
- jQuery UI to help with overall style and additions to the system.

**This was built for a university assignment.**
